## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### First Deployment

1. **Setup Database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test Production Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run start:prod
   ```

4. **Deploy to Production**
   
   **Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   **PM2:**
   ```bash
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 save
   ```
   
   **Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - [ ] Application is accessible
   - [ ] Health check returns 200: `curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health`
   - [ ] Authentication works
   - [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
   - [ ] All features work as expected

### Updates/Redeployments

1. **Pull Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Run Migrations** (if any)
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Restart Application**
   
   **Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   **PM2:**
   ```bash
   pm2 reload aternos-dashboard
   ```

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns healthy status
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Database queries execute successfully
- [ ] Real-time features work (WebSocket)
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Static assets load properly
- [ ] Images are optimized and loading
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (check response times)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are received (test)

## üîç Health Checks

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Database connectivity (should be checked by health endpoint)

# SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com
```

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Login with test account
- [ ] Create a test server
- [ ] Access server console
- [ ] Check real-time updates
- [ ] Test all major features

## üö® Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose pull  # Pull previous image
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **PM2:**
   ```bash
   git checkout previous-working-commit
   npm ci
   npm run build
   pm2 reload aternos-dashboard
   ```

3. **Database Rollback** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   psql -U user database < backup.sql
   ```
